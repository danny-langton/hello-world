This my first github learning attempt.
I so often save errors or just want to revert to some old code
I'm a long-retired 'computer guy' (teacher, installer, repairer, etc.)
Now I just do it for my own entertainment, education

I committed that last one too early - before checking with pull request.
Ill try again.
